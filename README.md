## Description

This project was completed in order to showcase my knowledge working with progressive web applications and utilizing webpacks in order to configure a full stack web application in which front and back end components can run independently or concurrently. This text editor also gives the user the ability to save notes and code snippets while off line as well.

## Badges

All of the coding methods in this project were those that were learned during the Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp. This was a refactor project, so a large portion of the code was provided and then code was added to make the application functional.
